"""Global constants for `bikenetlib` related to OpenStreetMap(OSM).

GROWABLE_NETWORK_CUSTOM_FILTER : list[str] or None
    Custom filter for all infrastructure elements that are considered as 
    growable by `growbikenet`. By default, `growbikenet` uses a custom filter 
    to retrieve the combined drive and pbi (protected bicycle infrastructure) 
    network. To only consider the drive network, set 
    `GROWABLE_NETWORK_CUSTOM_FILTER` to None and `GROWABLE_NETWORK_TYPE` to 
    'drive'. However, doing so can lead to issues: 
    https://github.com/BikeNetKit/GrowBikeNet/issues/255. 
GROWABLE_NETWORK_TYPE : {'drive', 'all', 'all_public', 'bike', 'drive_service', 'walk'}, default 'drive' 
        What type of street network to retrieve for the growable network if `GROWABLE_NETWORK_CUSTOM_FILTER` is None.
PBI_CUSTOM_FILTER : list[str]
    Custom filter for protected bicycle infrastructure (pbi).
PBI_DICT : dict
    Dictionary for protected bicycle infrastructure (pbi), for single criteria.
PBI_DICT_SUB : dict
    Dictionary for protected bicycle infrastructure (pbi), with one 
    sub-criterion. For example, highway~path AND bicycle~designated. Always 
    adds a second criterion access!~private.
ROUTING_PENALTY : dict, default {0: 1.5, 1: 1}
    Factor to multiply length of non-pbi/pbi for routing, to avoid routing
    through parallel streets when slightly longer pbi is available. By 
    default, non-pbi counts as 50% longer than pbi.
